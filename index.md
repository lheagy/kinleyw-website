# Kinley Wangmo
I am a hardworking, skilled, and compassionate caregiver trained at [Sprott Shaw College](https://sprottshaw.com/nursing-healthcare/health-care-assistant-program/) in Vancouver, British Columbia with hands-on experience in local care homes. As the eldest child raised by a single mother, caregiving is second nature to me. Canada has given me a home; now I hope to give back by caring for your family.
