I was raised in Bhutan by a single mother
who worked tirelessly as a gardener to give me and my siblings an
education. She sacrificed everything to keep our family strong, even
while being looked down upon for raising four children alone. As the
eldest, I grew up caring for my younger siblings and grandparents --
caregiving became second nature to me.

Life was not easy. As a child, I often stayed with my uncle because my
mother couldn't manage all four of us at once. Though he was kind, I
often went to bed with an empty stomach, unsure if I would get enough to
eat, feeling small and invisible in a world that seemed too big for me.
At five, I went to live with my father, where my stepmother mistreated
me. From a very young age I learned to cook, clean, wash clothes, and
dress myself. Those early hardships made me hardworking, resilient, and
determined to study and build a better future.

During the COVID pandemic, I met my husband
through social media, and he quickly became my greatest source of
strength. His own life had been full of struggles -- he grew up without
the right education due to an abusive stepfather, and in 2024, he lost
his beloved mother to cancer. Despite his own pain, he never gave up. He
worked as a chef and supported me emotionally and financially while I
prepared to come to Canada. After we arrived, he took on two jobs to pay
my school fees, rent, and living expenses. On his days off, he would
join me in cleaning jobs, and he always made sure I had healthy meals to
eat. He is hardworking, honest, and innocent at heart -- a man whose
love makes me feel the safety and care I once longed for from my own
father. I feel so lucky to have him by my side.

Coming to Canada was my dream, but it wasn't easy. My mother took loans
so my husband and I could make this journey. After we arrived, I was
blessed with the kindness of Tina, Tiara, and Tiara's parents, who
supported me with my studies and gave me hope when I needed it the most.
Tiara even rented me her basement room at a lower rent, and living close
to them feels like having a family again. Whenever I need a shoulder to
cry on, someone to share with, or advice to guide me, I find it in them.

Canada has given me more than anyone ever could -- when Tina noticed my
dedication while I was cleaning Airbnb homes, it was the first time I
felt seen and valued. That moment changed the course of my life, giving
me hope and a sense of belonging.

# Lessons from my journey
Through my journey, I have learned some of life's most important
lessons:

-   **Kindness has the power to change lives.** Even the smallest act of compassion can give someone hope when they feel like giving up.

-   **Hardship builds strength.** The struggles of my childhood taught me resilience, independence, and determination.

-   **Family is not only by blood.** The love and support I received from people like Tina, Tiara, and her parents made me realize that family is built from trust, care, and shared humanity.

I carry these lessons with me every day. My dream is to stand on my own
feet, become independent, and build a stable future. As a foreigner in
Canada, it is expensive to attend school and pursue higher education.
I'm deeply grateful to Tiara for organizing a GoFundMe project to cover
my tuition fees and to everyone who contributed. Their generosity --
along with the unwavering support of my husband -- made my dream
possible.

Now, I want to carry that kindness forward
through my work as a caregiver, offering compassion, dignity, and
respect to Canadian families. If you provide me with an LMIA and hire me
to care for your loved one, I will ensure they receive the highest
quality care. I am hardworking, dependable, and maintain a positive
attitude. Caring for the elderly reminds me of the love I shared with my
mother and grandparents, and every smile I bring to someone's face feels
like a piece of the home and family I missed as a child.

If you trust me with your loved one, I will care for them as my own --
with comfort, dignity, and joy. In doing so, I will continue the journey
of gratitude and love that brought me here.
