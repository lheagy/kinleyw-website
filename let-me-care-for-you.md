# Ready to hire me?

Please [get in touch](#get-in-touch) by phone or email so that we can discuss next steps.

As an immigrant to Canada, I will need your support to get a work permit. I have an immigration consultant who can handle all of the paper. While the work permit is being processed, I am ready to start immediately as a volunteer.

Below, I provide a few details about the work permit process.

## Overview for what I need to obtain a work permit

I am seeking an employer who can provide an [LMIA (Labour Market Impact
Assessment)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers.html) so I can continue working in Canada.

Here's what it means for you:

-   You can legally hire me as your caregiver.
-   The cost to you is [my wages](#employer-costs-and-payroll-information) plus the one-time government LMIA fee of
    \$1,000.

# Employer Costs and Payroll Information

To help families understand the real costs and responsibilities of
hiring me under an LMIA-supported work permit, here is a simple
breakdown based on a typical full-time schedule.

## Example Monthly Costs (40 hrs/week at \$23/hr)

::::{div}
:class: pay-card

| Item                      | Amount           |
|--------------------------|-----------------:|
| Gross wages              | $3,986           |
| CPP (5.95%)              | $237             |
| EI (2.21%)               | $88              |
| Vacation pay (4%)        | $159             |
| **Total employer cost**  | **‚âà $4,470 / month** |
::::

This represents about 12-13% above gross wages. The employee's share of
CPP, EI, and income tax will be deducted from wages and remitted by the
employer but does not add to employer out-of-pocket costs.

## Payroll and Administration

‚Ä¢ Employers must register with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) as a
household employer.\
‚Ä¢ CRA provides a free online Payroll Deductions Calculator to help
calculate deductions.\
‚Ä¢ Employers remit both employee deductions and employer contributions
monthly to CRA.\
‚Ä¢ Employers provide the employee with a T4 slip at year-end.\
‚Ä¢ Many families choose to use a payroll service (approx. \$30--50/month)
to automate these tasks.

Effort required is usually about 1-2 hours per month if handled
directly by the employer, or minimal if a payroll service is used.

# My commitment

If you hire me to care for your loved one and support my work permit, I
will ensure they receive the happiest, highest-quality care. I am
hardworking, dependable, and maintain a positive attitude. Caring for
the elderly makes me feel connected to my own mother and grandparents,
and it gives me deep satisfaction and purpose.

I will make sure you never regret hiring or helping me. I value loyalty,
gratitude, and trust, and I will bring those qualities into the care of
your loved one every single day.

I truly hope to meet you soon. While you help me fulfill my biggest
dream of building a future for my family, I will ensure your loved one
spends their days receiving the happiest, highest-quality care.
Together, we can create a relationship built on trust, compassion, and
respect -- and both of us will find what we are looking for.
